Good API documentation

Good API documentation allows any developer considering the API to quickly understand the purpose of the API, the data it works with, and how to send requests and parse the responses. Some documentation, particularly for large projects, even host samples you can run within the documentation to see the API in action. For the purposes of this course, you don't need to implement interactivity, but you will provide examples that can be run by someone viewing your documentation.

Here's a recap (for your reference) of the components that are typically included in good API documentation:

Introduction
Getting Started
Base URL
API Keys /Authentication (if applicable)
Errors
Response codes
Messages
Error types
Resource endpoint library
Organized by resource
Include each endpoint
Sample request
Arguments including data types
Response object including status codes and data types
